Login.tsx provides a centered card with username/password fields, error display, and masked password input. useAuth.ts manages sessionStorage-based authentication with hardcoded credentials. App.tsx conditionally renders Login or the full app. Header.tsx exposes a logout button. All major acceptance criteria are satisfied.",
